# Post-Disaster-Helper-App

Post-Disaster Helper App

Basic Points/Idea
- Have a basic tips page. Should contain measures and saved maps.
- People login to app and make their profiles, add their skills which might be useful during the disaster. This is while installing the app much before the disaster.
- The app shows group of people which are in connectable BT range are shown on the saved map using heat maps.
- These groups have individual forum pages where any person can rise issue and people can follow up on the same
- Govt. Can access the location of these groups using location tracking services and if internet is available, they can easily get to know about the specific problem a particular group of people are facing and act accordingly.
- If internet is available even to one person, there can be inter-group or gov-group communication and govt will be able to access all the forums individually
- Usage of phone battery should be minimized restricting all other unnecessary operations.

Implementation Points



GITHUB Draft

What are you building:-

- An app which supports collaboration among people to help each other out during/after the disaster, using the skills they know best.
- Connect people within a group together and if internet is available, to the govt.

How does it work:-
- Switch bluetooth and GPS In in all phones, and connect nearby people together by making a ‘BT’ group.
- Relay messages and information over this group using BT.
- Relay cumulative group location to the govt. using location services.

Getting started:-
- Before the disaster, the users are required to make their profile. They should have updated the skills they possess which might be useful during the time of calamity viz. Doctor, electrician etc.
- When the disaster hits, everyone switches to the app. Nearby people gets connected and a group is formed.
- Every group has its own requests and discussion forum where anyone in need of something can be provided help by any other member of the same group.
- People can ping other members of the same group in case of any emergency related to the person's skillet.
- The app will also have saved maps with locations of emergency centers, like hospitals,, rescue centres etc.
- Collaborative support would help people to not panic in such a tense situation.
- Even if one person has access to internet, the whole group's data could be accessed by govt. agencies and other groups. This would help govt. plan their rescue in a better way considering the demands of a particular group of people.

Datasets we are using:-

- Saved offline maps showing the locations of rescue centers, hospitals etc. For offline guidance
- No prediction model trained here, but the data from this app can be used to train a model to predict the movement of humans during an emergency like of a disaster.
- Technologies we  are using
- Cloud services for storing the forums of individual group
- Bluetooth services for communication and data sharing
- Location services for the govt. To know precisely what place to plan the rescue missions.
